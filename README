DELETING DECKS CONFIGURATIONS

ENGLISH WORD LOOKUP

This one is for looking up definitions of the English words. It looks up the word in one field and puts the definition in another field. Work with words only.

The words-lookup.py file tell the program which field to check for word (line 12) and where to put the definition (line 14). 

When in Anki, open the Browse window. Highlight the cards that you want to check. Under menu Edit, there is a button generate meaning. Click it. If the word was in the dictionary, the definition is posted in appropriate field.

In order for it to work, there needs to be a dictionary.json file somewhere on the disk. In the file, on line 16, write in the location of the dictionary.json file.

The program is using the json version of Webster's Unabridged English Dictionary. The project dealing with this can be found on https://github.com/adambom/dictionary
