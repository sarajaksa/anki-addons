This program is an addon for a SRS learning program Anki, which you can find on http://ankisrs.net/ . It provides a more convenient way to change the number of new cards to learn and how many cards to review for multiple decks. 

To install this program, you need to have Anki installed first. Then simply copy the New_and_max_cards.py to the addon folder inside your Anki profile. 

The program adds the button New/Max Cards Configuration to Tools menu.

You can also install this addon to copy the code 3179425861 to the Anki addon istaller. The Anki's page for this addon is on https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/3179425861 .

The last change to this program was made on 18th of July 2014. It was to add the scrolling function for the people that use the huge amount of decks. 

For any questions, complains or comments, you can reach me on sarajaksa@gmail.com .
